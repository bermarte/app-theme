From [YHF](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/incremental-development#week-2):  

This week's project is to study the [__app-theme__ tutorial from Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlA7dputiNc).

Writing the same code as Mr. Traversy's code is not enough! You are expected to submit your code from his tutorial in a new repository on your GitHub account [forked](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) from [this starter template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/w3-validation-template).  Your repository should be named `app-theme` and should be cleanly developed with one branch per step.  It's up to you to write the development strategy!

A good strategy to for completing this project is the __three-step__:
1. follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project.
2. look over your finished code and break it down into steps, write your development strategy.
3. study the tutorial a second time, following your strategy to build your repository one branch at a time

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, your development strategy, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must contain:
