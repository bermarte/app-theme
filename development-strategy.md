# Development Strategy

> `app-theme`

Following the tutorial provided we have to rebuild a website containing 4 pages, each on a branch. For every branch we need to create a pull request to the master and merge it later with the master. The foundation and preliminary preparation of this exercise consists of writing and developing a clean development strategy and creating a wireframe. This time we will use the [FlexBox CSS Layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to build a a responsive HTML template.
