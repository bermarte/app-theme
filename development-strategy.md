# Development Strategy

> `app-theme`

Following the tutorial provided we have to rebuild a website containing 4 pages, each on a branch. For every branch we need to create a pull request to the master and merge it later with the master. The foundation and preliminary preparation of this exercise consists of writing and developing a clean development strategy and creating a wireframe. This time we will use the [FlexBox CSS Layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to build a a responsive HTML template.


[GO TO THE README](README.md)

- who would want to use it?  

This is a starter project for a beginner, it covers the CSS Flexbox Layout. We learn how to work with branches, how to develop a strategy to build this and future projects.

- why would they want to use it?  

CSS Flexbox is a new way to create layouts using HTML and CSS efficiently, better than using float properties.

## Wireframe

<!-- include a wireframe for your project in this repository, and display it here -->
<!-- wireframe.cc is a good site for getting started with wireframes -->

## 0 Set-Up:
* Read the text of the assignment
* follow the tutorial step by step

### Repo

1. On Github Generate Repo from Template
1. Write initial, basic README
1. Write initial, basic development strategy
1. Turn on GitHub Pages (https://bermarte.github.io/acme-web-design/)
1. Clone this repo locally
1. Edit your development strategy 
1. add, commit, push on GitHub server your development strategy

### Steps to follow (general overview)

1. locally, make a new branch  
   `git branch branch_name`
2. Switch to the new branch  
  `git checkout branch_name`   
   copy the files for that branch and add the HYF template to check the code later   
3. Add the branch_file to your local repository (Staging)  
   `git add file_name`
4. Commit the changes  
  `git commit -m " message"`
6. Switch to the master branch  
  `git checkout master`
7. Repeat 1. to 6. for every branch   
8. On your client, chekout one branch at the time   
 `git checkout branch_name`
9. Push it to this repository creating the branch on the server     
 `git push --set-upstream origin branch_name`
10. Compare, create a pull request on GitHub, write a message, merge and confirm
11. Repeat 8. to 10. for every branch
12. On GitHub, continue writing the Development strategy (this file) 
13. Using githubpages, validate and debug the html files, the CSS and the rest using the template of HYF
14. Pull master to local
15. Fix the errors found at 13. on your local computer
16. Once finished push the changes to the server

## 1. User Story: COPY THE IMAGES 

* Create locally the branch images   
`git branch images`
* Copy the images folder, stage it and commit
* Push the branch to GitHub and create the same branch online   
`git push origin images`   
* Write the step in the Development strategy using Github and save it (stage it and commit)
### Branches

1. This user story was developed on a brach called `images`
2. It was merged to `master` when the feature was finished (#Write step 1 in development strategy)
